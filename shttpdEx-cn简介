shttpdEx-cn project:
	this is a bullshit project, a lot bug, it cant even pass the gcc compile;
	even you fixed the compile problem, and then you will figure it out one thing: this project is all bullshit !!
	it's a project from a chinese book named: 
		<Linux网络编程>
		2010年1月清华大学出版社出版的图书, 作者是宋敬彬、孙海滨;

	feel so shame to this people, even they are going to publish out in books, but they'll never show you the useful codes,
	write some bullshit to show up his ass, that's what they want,
	they got fames, they got money, and fooling you around and telling you that you cant learn this;
	it's true!!

	The lesson learned is: 
		never fixed a shit project, it's irreparable, 
		all you need to do is choose a new project to follow, and finish your development mission;
		good choices always Mr.Rgiht
